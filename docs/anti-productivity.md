# The AntiProductivity Mindset

## What *AntiProductivity* Means

The term *AntiProductivity* is not against doing good work — quite the opposite.

It's about shifting the focus away from:
- minute-by-minute tracking
- time quotas
- artificial optimization pressure
- productivity metrics that don't reflect real value

And moving towards:
- understanding what you actually *accomplished*
- reflecting on the *meaning* of your work
- embracing *context* instead of raw output

## Why Traditional Productivity Metrics Fall Short

Many traditional tools assume:
- that more tracked time means more productivity
- that optimization accelerates value creation
- that metrics correlate with outcomes

But reality is more complex. Human work is rarely linear, especially in software:
- deep thinking can span hours with limited physical activity
- context switches are natural in knowledge work
- impact doesn't scale with minutes logged

## How anker Fits In

anker is designed to:
1. Reconstruct your work from your existing source of truth (like Git)
2. Provide a *narrative recap* in natural text
3. Encourage reflection instead of performance anxiety

This is the essence of the **#AntiProductivity mindset**.

## Why it Matters

For individuals:
- reduce guilt about "untracked time"
- capture real accomplishments
- create summaries you can actually use

For teams:
- generate readable standup text
- improve asynchronous communication
- reduce noise from meaningless metrics
